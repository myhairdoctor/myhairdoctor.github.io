    <div class="section" id="medications">
        <h2>1. Medications for Hair Loss</h2>
        <h3>A. Minoxidil</h3>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Minoxidil is a vasodilator that improves blood flow to hair follicles, prolonging the hair’s growth (anagen) phase.</p>
        <p><strong>Forms:</strong> Available in 2% and 5% solutions, applied topically to the scalp.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A <em>48-week clinical trial</em> with 393 men found 5% Minoxidil regrowth was 45% greater than with 2% and 2.6 times higher than with placebo.</li>
                <li>A <em>1-year study</em> with 381 women reported increased hair density by 13 hairs/cm² with 2% Minoxidil.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Side Effects:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Common: Scalp irritation, dryness, or itching.</li>
                <li>Rare: Excessive facial hair growth (in women).</li>
                <li>Initial shedding during early use, resolving within weeks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>B. Finasteride</h3>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Finasteride blocks 5-alpha reductase, reducing DHT, a key driver of follicular miniaturization.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A <em>2-year trial</em> reported 83% of users maintained or increased hair density, gaining 182 hairs compared to placebo.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Side Effects:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sexual dysfunction reported by 3.8% of users versus 2.1% in placebo groups.</li>
                <li>Rare: Depression or anxiety, post-finasteride syndrome.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>C. Dutasteride</h3>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Dutasteride inhibits both Type 1 and Type 2 forms of 5-alpha reductase.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A <em>6-month study</em> found dutasteride increased hair counts by 109 hairs, outperforming finasteride and placebo.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Additional Research:</strong> A study in the <a href="https://ijdvl.com/superiority-of-dutasteride-over-finasteride-in-hair-regrowth-and-reversal-of-miniaturization-in-men-with-androgenetic-alopecia-a-randomized-controlled-open-label-evaluator-blinded-study/">Indian Journal of Dermatology</a> confirmed dutasteride's superiority over finasteride for hair regrowth in men.</p>
        <p><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Similar to finasteride, with slightly higher incidence of sexual dysfunction.</p>

    <div class="section" id="non-surgical">
        <h2>2. Non-Surgical Treatments</h2>

        <h3>A. Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)</h3>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> PRP involves extracting the patient’s blood, isolating platelet-rich plasma, and injecting it into the scalp to stimulate follicle activity via growth factors.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A meta-analysis reported a 33.6 hairs/cm² increase in PRP-treated individuals compared to 8.5 hairs/cm² in placebo groups.</li>
                <li>A <a href="https://ijdvl.com/efficacy-of-platelet-rich-plasma-in-asians-with-androgenetic-alopecia-a-randomized-controlled-trial/">study in the Indian Journal of Dermatology</a> found significant increases in hair density for men but not for women.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Minimal, including mild swelling or discomfort at the injection site.</p>

        <h3>B. Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT)</h3>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong> Red light lasers stimulate follicles and enhance blood flow.</p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong> A 16-week study reported a 39% improvement in hair density for LLLT users.</p>
        <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Requires long-term commitment with treatments 2–3 times per week.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="surgical">
        <h2>3. Surgical Options</h2>

        <h3>A. Hair Transplant Surgery</h3>
        <p><strong>Methods:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT): Removes a strip of scalp for grafting.</li>
                <li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE): Harvests individual follicles directly.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Efficacy:</strong> Success rates range from 90–95%, with natural and permanent hair growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Cost:</strong> Ranges from ₹1,00,000–₹3,00,000 ($1,500–$4,000) for 1,500–3,000 grafts in India.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="placebo">
        <h2>4. Placebo Comparisons</h2>
        <p>All treatments significantly outperformed placebo, demonstrating their effectiveness in combating hair loss:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minoxidil: 2.6x better regrowth compared to placebo.</li>
            <li>Finasteride: Net gain of 182 hairs versus placebo.</li>
            <li>Dutasteride: Net gain of 165 hairs compared to placebo.</li>
            <li>PRP: Over 25 hairs/cm² more than placebo.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="conclusion">
        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
