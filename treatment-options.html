            <h2>Medications</h2>
            <p>Medications such as Finasteride, Dutasteride, and Minoxidil are commonly prescribed for hair loss. Here’s what the research says:</p>
            <h3>Finasteride vs. Dutasteride</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finasteride:</strong> Shown to reduce hair loss in 65% of men over 2 years with minimal side effects like decreased libido (around 1.8% of users).</li>
                <li><strong>Dutasteride:</strong> More effective than Finasteride, with the Indian Journal of Dermatology reporting better hair density outcomes. However, it is not FDA-approved for hair loss in the USA but is widely used in Korea and Japan.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Minoxidil</h3>
            <p>Topical Minoxidil stimulates hair growth by improving blood flow to hair follicles. Clinical trials show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Men:</strong> 40-60% experience visible improvement within 4-6 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Women:</strong> 60% report hair regrowth in areas of thinning.</li>
                <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Scalp irritation and shedding during the initial weeks of use.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <!-- PRP Therapy -->
    <section id="prp" class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>PRP Therapy</h2>
            <p>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy involves injecting your own plasma into the scalp to stimulate hair growth. According to the Indian Journal of Dermatology:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Men showed a statistically significant increase in hair density.</li>
                <li>Women did not show statistically significant results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>PRP often requires 3-6 sessions for noticeable results and can be used as a complementary treatment to hair transplants.</p>

            <h2>Hair Transplants</h2>
            <p>Hair transplantation is a surgical solution for restoring hair in areas of significant thinning or baldness. Key facts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE).</li>
                <li><strong>Success Rate:</strong> 85-95% graft survival rate reported in clinical studies.</li>
                <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Requires downtime, and results take 6-12 months to fully manifest.</li>
            </ul>
