    <!-- The Science Behind Hair Loss -->

        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Science Behind Hair Loss</h2>
            <p>Hair loss occurs when the hair growth cycle is disrupted. This cycle consists of three main phases:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Anagen:</strong> The active growth phase lasting 2-7 years.</li>
                <li><strong>Catagen:</strong> The transition phase lasting about 10 days.</li>
                <li><strong>Telogen:</strong> The resting phase, after which hair sheds and the cycle restarts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Conditions like androgenetic alopecia shorten the anagen phase, causing hair follicles to shrink and produce thinner, weaker hair over time.</p>

                <li><strong>Blood Tests:</strong> To identify underlying conditions like thyroid imbalances or nutrient deficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Trichoscopy:</strong> A detailed examination of the scalp and hair follicles using a specialized device.</li>
